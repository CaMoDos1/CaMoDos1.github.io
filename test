            “Of all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It
            would be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron's
            cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those who torment us for our
            own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience.” — C.S. Lewis

        <p>Dear strangers,</p>
        <p>From the moment I discovered the Internet at a young age, it has been a magical place to me. Growing up in a
            small town, relatively isolated from the larger world, it was a revelation how much more there was to discover
            – how many interesting people and ideas the world had to offer.</p>
